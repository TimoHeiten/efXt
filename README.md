# efXt

Aim of this library:
* Use Ef Core with common functionality so you dont have to implement it over and over again.
  * Specification pattern for repeatable queries
  * UnitOfWork and Rollback for better control of the ChangeTracking  
* Make it easy to register the dbContext and let the abstractions be injected so you can test your code without repetitive mocks for Repositories and such

Examples tbd.
